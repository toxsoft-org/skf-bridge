Needs to be fixed:
 
--- icons/ directory content violates ToxSoft's MWS rules
--- clean-up unsed icons from icons/
--- create ICONID_XXX constant in IBridgeCfgModbusConstants
--- use ICONID_XXX instead of other means in the code (if any icon is used)


Rename entities
--- ModbusToS5CfgDoc -> ModbugBridgeCfg (also rename related files like M5, panels, etc)
